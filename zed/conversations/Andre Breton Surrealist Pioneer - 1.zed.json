Surrealism: He is best known as the principal founder and theorist of Surrealism, an influential avant-garde movement in art and literature that began in the 1920s.\n\n3. Manifesto: Breton wrote the Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, which outlined the principles and goals of the movement.\n\n4.

Influence: His ideas and writings had a profound impact on art, literature, and thought in the 20th century.\n\n6. Philosophy: Breton was interested in the unconscious mind, dreams, and automatic writing as ways to access deeper truths and creativity.\n\n7.
